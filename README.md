### Unit Testing Questions:

1. Sending a message requires the function of text input, network call, database, and recipient functions. Since a unit test is meant to be a modular test of a singular function, it is not appropriate to test the full "message" pipeline.

2. Yes, I would use a unit test to test the max message length since the functino is a deterministic piece of logic, and should behave very reliably under a single modular test.
